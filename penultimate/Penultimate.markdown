# Wire-framing On the Go

Wireframes can be quite in-depth or incredibly simple.  Different people work in their own way and each can argue the merits of their own style. I won't bother attempting to convince you of a certain style.  I'll merely say that I find a very simple wireframe invaluable in my workflow.

Many times when jumping straight into the design process I would find myself sacrificing usability or best practices because I was stuck on some 'really cool' element or idea that I 'had to have' in the design. Creating a very simplistic wire-frame keeps me from focusing on the wrong items so that I can focus on more important things like layout, navigation and flow. I've also found that often clients find it hard to distinguish between design and content and so they sometimes reject a design on the basis that the content is not right. This can be quite frustrating for a UX team as they try to walk the client through the user path.

## I tried to follow the crowd

I had tried using Omnigraffle (one of the most widely adopted wireframing tools) and a few other wire-framing tools several times before to create wireframes but personally find it a bit too in-depth and slow. I always seem to end up back in front of a white board with a fat marker. (a fat marker is key for me; the skinny ones tempt me to add too much detail)

You can see the difference of detail between the two types of wire frames:

##### An Omnigraffle wireframe:

##### White-boarding the 'ole fashioned way:

But this would present a whole new issue. I'd be at a meeting or coffee shop and suddenly have no access to my wireframes! This led to me taking pictures of my wireframes and trying to interact with them through my phone.  Again, not the best solution.

## Enter Penultimate

A coworker recently showed me an iPad app called [Penultimate](http://itunes.apple.com/app/penultimate/id354098826).  The app is one of the top selling hand-writing apps in the app store. As I am not big on hand-writing (mine is quite unattractive) I paid little attention originally.  However, [CocoaBox](http://www.cocoabox.com/), the makers of Penultimate recently made an addition to the app that changed everything.

### Custom Paper

CocoaBox added a custom paper feature to Penultimate that allows you to change the paper type of each notebook. The app ships with some standard paper types like graph, lined and plain. Built into the app is a *paper shop* where you can purchase additional paper types at around one dollar per pack. However, the real winner for me was the ability to upload your own images to use as custom paper types.

While there are some cool custom paper types in the store, none really fit my use for brainstorming websites and web apps. So I dusted off Photoshop and began laying some grids down. I ended up with 11 custom papers covering the browser, iPad and iPhone; all designed for the iPad screen size.

#### Examples

Here are a three examples for context:
